As a ResTek Server Admin at Western Washington University, I manage and maintain the servers and networks that provide internet access and support to over 4,000 students living on campus. I troubleshoot and resolve technical issues, monitor and optimize system performance, and ensure compliance with security policies and protocols.

I have a passion for cybersecurity and a strong background in computer hardware, operating system, and network administration. I hold multiple CompTIA certifications, including A+, Security+, and Network+, and I have completed an internship at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where I contributed to the design and development of a web application for data visualization and analysis for the Deep Space Network. I will complete my degree at Western Washington University in 2024, where I have taken courses in cryptography, network security, and ethical hacking. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to a full-time role in the cybersecurity industry after graduation.  I will be graduating from Western Washington University in June 2024, with a degree in Computer Science and Society.
