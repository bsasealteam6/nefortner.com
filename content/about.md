My name is Nate Fortner, and I will be graduating June 2024 from Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington, with a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science and Society and a minor in Computer Science. During my time in college, I have also been working as a Linux Systems Administrator for the university’s housing department and hold CompTIA certifications in A+, Network+, and Security+.

I began working with computers in middle school and have continually sought ways to develop my skills. In high school, I completed the Val Tech mechatronics diploma, and I further honed my abilities through a summer internship with NASA JPL in California and various IT jobs during college. At NASA JPL, I served as a Design Interaction Intern on the Deep Space Network team, modernizing satellite controls. I have been working professionally in IT since 2016, most recently with Western Washington University’s IT team, where I maintained the network system for the college residence department. During my tenure, I led a major migration to new servers without disrupting any hosted services.

To further enhance my cybersecurity skills, I have been an active member of Western Washington University’s Cybersecurity Club since 2020. I have participated in several competitions and conferences, filed incident reports, and prepared technical security documentation. As co-captain of the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition Team, I helped harden Windows and Linux systems, provided organized and effective client support, and navigated relentless attacks from skilled industry professionals.

Throughout my education, work in IT, and personal experiences, I have developed extensive skills in IT, teamwork, and collaboration. I have learned to set and achieve goals and can work independently or as part of a team to successfully complete complex tasks.
